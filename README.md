# Library_Management
The goal of this project is to create a system for library management. The system will allow performance of the actions needed in order to manage the library in a simple and comfortable way.  The  actions will include addition/removal of books, addition/removal of members, member and book searches, and much more. The system in parallel to the user actions keeps  a basic security level which prevents access or modifications of data by users which don't posses the proper permissions.
